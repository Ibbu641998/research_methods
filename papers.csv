Ensemble Learning for Facial Age Estimation Within Non-Ideal Facial Imagery,N. Yu; L. Qian; Y. Huang; Y. Wu,"College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China; College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China; College of Information Engineering, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China; Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Macau, Macau, China",IEEE Access,01-Aug-19,2019,7,,97938,97948,"Human facial age estimation has been widely used in many computer vision applications, including security surveillance, forensics, biometrics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and so on. We propose a facial age estimation method oriented to non-ideal facial imagery. The method consists of image preprocessing, feature extraction, and age predication. First, we preprocess non-ideal input images in RGB stream, luminance modified (LM) stream, and YIQ stream. Then, we leverage the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to extract the feature of images preprocessed in each stream. To reduce the training data volume and training complexity, we adopt the transfer learning to build the DCNN structure. With the extracted feature, the weak classifier equipped at every stream is designed to obtain a weak classification prediction of the age range. Moreover, in order to generate estimation, we use the ensemble learning to fuse the three weak classifiers. We design an integrated strategy algorithm based on the combination of voting method and weighted average method. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can improve the an exact match (AEM) and an error of one age category (AEO) by 4.75% and 6.75% compared with the best AEM and AEO of the three weak classifiers. Furthermore, in comparison with the unweighted average method, our proposed algorithm can improve the AEM and AEO by 8.68% and 12.79%, respectively.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2928843,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572440,61379122); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LR16F010003,LR17F010002); Southeast University(grant numbers:2019D11); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8763944,Facial age estimation;transfer learning;ensemble learning;deep convolutional neural network;image preprocessing,Feature extraction;Estimation;Streaming media;Image color analysis;Training;Colored noise;Support vector machines,convolutional neural nets;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence),ensemble learning;nonideal facial imagery;human facial age estimation;facial age estimation method;image preprocessing;feature extraction;age predication;preprocess nonideal input images;RGB stream;YIQ stream;deep convolutional neural networks;training data volume;training complexity;transfer learning;weak classifier;voting method;weighted average method;age category;unweighted average method;one age category;an exact match;luminance modified stream,,6,,41,CCBY,15-Jul-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,yes,yes,,,
Comprehensive Analysis of the Literature for Age Estimation From Facial Images,A. S. Al-Shannaq; L. A. Elrefaei,"Computer Science Department, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Computer Science Department, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",IEEE Access,25-Jul-19,2019,7,,93229,93249,"Recently, vast attention has grown in the field of computer vision, especially in face recognition, detection, and facial landmarks localization. Many significant features can be directly derived from the human face, such as age, gender, and race. Estimating the age can be defined as the automatic process of classifying the facial image into the exact age or to a specific age range. Practically, age estimation from the face is still a challenging problem due to the effects from many internal factors, such as gender and race, and external factors, such as environments and lifestyle. Huge efforts have been addressed to reach an accepted and satisfied accuracy of age estimation task. In this paper, we try to analyze the main aspects that can increase the performance of the age estimation system, present the handcrafted-based models and deep learning-based models, and show how the evaluations are being conducted, discuss the proposed algorithms and models in the age estimation, and show the main limitations and challenges facing the age estimation process. Also, different aging databases that contain age annotations are discussed. Finally, few guidelines and the future prospect related to the age estimation are investigated.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927825,King Abdulaziz University(grant numbers:DG1440-17-611); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758426,Age estimation;deep learning;handcrafted;CNN;age estimation algorithms,Servers;Smart phones;Batteries;Power demand;Proposals;Data transfer;Protocols,computer vision;convolutional neural nets;estimation theory;face recognition;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence),age estimation system;age annotations;facial landmarks localization;convolutional neural network;CNN;aging databases;deep learning-based models;handcrafted-based models;face detection;face recognition;computer vision;facial image classification,,16,,120,CCBY,09-Jul-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,yes,yes,,,
Gender-Driven Emotion Recognition Through Speech Signals For Ambient Intelligence Applications,I. Bisio; A. Delfino; F. Lavagetto; M. Marchese; A.

The provided solution is aimed at improving the interaction among humans and computers, thus allowing effective human-computer intelligent interaction. The system is able to recognize six emotions(anger, boredom, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) and the neutral state. This set of emotional states is widely used for emotion recognition purposes. It also distinguishes a single emotion versus all the other possible ones, as proven in the proposed numerical results. The system is composed of two subsystems: 1) gender recognition(GR) and 2) emotion recognition(ER). The experimental analysis shows the performance in terms of accuracy of the proposed ER system. The results highlight that the a priori knowledge of the speaker's gender allows a performance increase. The obtained results show also that the features selection adoption assures a satisfying recognition rate and allows reducing the employed features. Future developments of the proposed solution may include the implementation of this system over mobile devices such as smartphones.",2168-6750,,10.1109/TETC.2013.2274797,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568890,Human-computer intelligent interaction;gender recognition;emotion recognition;pitch estimation;support vector machine,Emotion recognition;Gender issues;Speech recognition;Databases;Feature extraction;Support vector machines,audio signal processing;emotion recognition;feature selection;human computer interaction;speaker recognition;support vector machines,gender-driven emotion recognition;speech signals;ambient intelligence applications;person emotional state recognition;audio signal registrations;human-computer intelligent interaction;anger;boredom;disgust;fear;happiness;sadness;neutral state;GR;ER system;a priori knowledge;speaker gender;features selection adoption;recognition rate;mobile devices;smartphones;support vector machine,,62,,42,CCBY,25-Jul-13,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,,,yes,,,
Exploiting effective facial patches for robust gender recognition,J. Cheng; Y. Li; J. Wang; L. Yu; S. Wang,"Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN; Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN; Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN; China Mobile Information Security Center, Beijing 100084, China; Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN",Tsinghua Science and Technology,24-Jan-19,2019,24,3,333,345,"Gender classification is an important task in automated face analysis. Most existing approaches for gender classification use only raw/aligned face images after face detection as input. These methods exhibit fair classification ability under constrained conditions, in which face images are acquired under similar illumination with similar poses. The performances of these methods may deteriorate when face images show drastic variances in poses and occlusion as routinely encountered in real-world data. The reduction in the performances of current gender classification methods may be attributed to the sensitiveness of features to image translations. This work proposes to alleviate this sensitivity by introducing a majority voting procedure that involves multiple face patches. Specifically, this work utilizes a deep learning method based on multiple large patches. Several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are trained on individual, predefined patches that reflect various image resolutions and partial cropping. The decisions of each CNN are aggregated through majority voting to obtain the final gender classification accurately. Extensive experiments are conducted on four gender classification databases, including Labeled Face in-the-Wild (LFW), CelebA, ColorFeret, and All-Age Faces database, a novel database collected by our group. Each individual patch is evaluated, and complementary patches are selected for voting. We show that the classification accuracy of our method is comparable with that of state-of-the-art systems. This characteristic validates the effectiveness of our proposed method.",1007-0214,,10.26599/TST.2018.9010090,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8620951,gender classification;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);majority voting,Face;Databases;Training;Face recognition;Task analysis;Image recognition;Hair,convolutional neural nets;face recognition;feature extraction;gender issues;image classification;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence),image translations;majority voting procedure;deep learning method;image resolutions;gender classification databases;All-Age Faces database;effective facial patches;robust gender recognition;automated face analysis;fair classification ability;similar illumination;similar poses;raw-aligned face images;convolutional neural networks;CNN;partial cropping;ColorFeret database;LFW database;CelebA database;Labeled Face in-the-Wild database,,36,,,,24-Jan-19,,,TUP,TUP Journals,,yes,yes,,,
"One Source to Detect them All: Gender, Age, and Emotion Detection from Voice",S. R. Zaman; D. Sadekeen; M. A. Alfaz; R. Shahriyar,"Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh; Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh","2021 IEEE 45th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)",09-Sep-21,2021,,,338,343,"Gender, age, and emotion detection from the speech are essential in machine and human interaction. Sometimes it is required to categorize audios by age and gender from speech. Sometimes it is required to predict age, gender, and emotion from audio clips for investigation purposes. Most telecommunication companies need to analyze audio calls to predict customer demography and recommend offers based on demographic segments. Several researchers have focused on detecting gender, age, and emotion from different types of sources. But according to the best of our knowledge, none of them use a single type of source to detect all of them. We have introduced a system to detect gender, age, and emotion from audio speech. In our system, all audio files were converted into 20 statistical features, and the converted numerical datasets were used to create the different prediction models to attain the objective. The different prediction models are Random Forest, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Artificial neural networks (ANN), Naive Bayes, and Support vector machine (SVM). All the prediction models were evaluated and compared based on their test accuracy. In predicting gender, CatBoost performs best among all predictive models with 96.4% test accuracy. On the other hand, Random Forest performs best for predicting age among all predicting models with 70.4% test accuracy. For emotion prediction, XGBoost performs best with 66.1% test accuracy. It was also analyzed among 20 features which features are most influential for the effective prediction models. We believe that our findings will be beneficial to future researchers in this area.",0730-3157,978-1-6654-2463-9,10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00055,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9529731,Gender Detection;Age Detection;Emotion Detection;Voice Data,Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Demography;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Software;Numerical models,Bayes methods;decision trees;emotion recognition;gradient methods;nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines,emotion detection;detecting gender;audio speech;audio files;random forest;emotion prediction;age detection;gender detection;statistical features;CatBoost;gradient boosting;k-nearest neighbors;KNN;XGBoost;AdaBoost;decision tree;artificial neural networks;ANN;support vector machine;Naive Bayes;SVM,,6,,15,IEEE,09-Sep-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,yes,yes,,,
