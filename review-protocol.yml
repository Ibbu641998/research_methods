Revised Topic
Gender and Age Detection with Deep Learning: Analysing Facial Attributes for Intelligent Applications"
1. Introduction: The role of age and gender in social interactions, as well as the relevance of these factors in applications such as access control, human-computer interface, and law enforcement.
2. Dataset and Methodology: The goal of this study is to create a gender and age detector utilising deep learning, with an emphasis on CNN technology and data mining approaches.
3. Facial Analysis Difficulties: Face detection complexity owing to illumination, position, and expressions. Variations in perceived compared to true age. The significance of facialÂ features such as brows and facial landmarks.
4. Deep Learning Approaches: Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately estimate gender and age from face photos. Increasing database variety and workflow management.
5. Review of the Literature: Previous studies on age, gender, and emotion detection from voice and face imagery. Real-world data challenges and potential solutions utilising CNNs.
6. Conclusion: Potential applications of gender and age detection, the necessity of data-driven algorithms, and the need for additional accuracy and resilience developments.

Research Question
